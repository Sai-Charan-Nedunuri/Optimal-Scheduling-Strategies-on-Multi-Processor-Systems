# Optimal Scheduling Strategies on Multi Processor Systems
 Under the guidance of Prof. Abhishek Mishra, we have attempted to find an Optimal Task Scheduling Strategy on Homogeneous Multi Processor Systems by considering the network of authors and their research papers during the period 2000-2018. Suggested and implemented Duplication based novel milp algorithm with various constraints, Exhaustive list scheduling (ELS), Allocation - Ordering algorithm (AO), and introduced various decision variables in Duplication based scheduling algorithm. As a result of imposing constraints, schedule length is found to be increased indicating the tradeoff between constraints and the schedule length.
